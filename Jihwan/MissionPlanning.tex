\section{Mission Planning} \label{missionplanning}

\subsection{Objectives and Existing Works}

\iffalse
- list what the existing works on path planning use
- list what the existing companies for mine detection drones use as their algorithm if they can be found
\fi

The mission planning of the multi-aerial drone system focuses on how to efficiently plan the paths of the drones to survey our \gls{roi} using the chosen suite of sensors. The input will be the user-defined \gls{roi} and the specifications of the drone system, which goes through the mission planning algorithm to output the set of coordinates each drone must follow.

Existing works focus 

We aim to improve on these works by proposing a \textit{Layered Approach} to the mission planning of our drone system to optimise the time and resources required.  

\subsection{Layered Approach}

\iffalse
- mention the use of thermal and GPSAR sensors for detection
- explain what the layered approach is following the steps in the presentation
- form a mathematical equation for how much time it can save compared to previous methods
\fi

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Define} the region of interest and obstacles.
    \item \textbf{Cover} the area using a thermal sensor through a \gls{cpp} algorithm.
    \item \textbf{Analyse} the thermal readings using a machine learning algorithm to find the suspected points.
    \item \textbf{Target} and rescan the suspected points using a \gls{gpr} sensor through a \gls{tspo} algorithm.
    \item \textbf{Confirm} the landmine locations with the \gls{gpr} readings. 
    \item \textbf{Demine} using the generated landmine location map. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Defining the Region of Interest}

\iffalse
- explain Polygon with Holes data type in CGAL, and why it's an efficient why to describe our ROI
- explain the use of QGIS and how it's easy for an inexperienced operator to use
- explain the skeleton algorithm to give a border if required
- extension: using a deep-nn to automatically detect the likely locations?
\fi

\subsection{Coverage Path Planning}

\iffalse
- boustrophedon path planning. boustrophedon cell decomposition. previous research on this field.
- optimising with respect to the number of turns, distance, etc. 
- ASL cpp algorithm will be used on a virtual machine. explain how the algorithm works
\fi

\subsection{Travelling Salesman Problem with Obstacles}

\iffalse 
- what is a normal TSP
- how is TSP-O different from TSP
- how to simplify a TSP-O into a normal TSP by the use of visibility graph
- demonstration using a simple ROI (square within square) to show how it works
- time complexity and justification for our application (not real time, not too detailed roi)
\fi 

\subsection{Expanding to a Multi-Drone Operation}

\iffalse
- possible options such as straight line division but why i chose divide and cluster
- explanation of the divide and cluster algorithm
- delanauy triangulation, clustering algorithm
- time complexity (if it can be found) 
- appeal how expandable this would be for multi-aerial drone system
